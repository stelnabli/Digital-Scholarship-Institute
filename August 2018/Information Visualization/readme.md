# Information Visualization with Raw

Welcome, DSI cohort! Below you will find information about our session. You won't need to pre-install anything on your computer to participate, but **you will absolutely need a laptop in order to create visualizations with the browser-based online tool RAWgraphs**. Please email us if you have any questions before the session.

### Instructors

Megan Ozeran, Data Analytics and Visualization Librarian, mozeran@illinois.edu

### Learning Goals

1) Critically evaluate information visualizations in order to understand their content as well as determine the authority of the message.

2) Create new information visualizations using standard principles and the RAWgraphs tool in order to enhance your and your colleaguesâ€™ scholarship.

3) Identify one or two opportunities to incorporate information visualization methods into faculty or student collaborations in order to demonstrate confidence in using and promoting information visualization as a mode of digital scholarship research and dissemination.
